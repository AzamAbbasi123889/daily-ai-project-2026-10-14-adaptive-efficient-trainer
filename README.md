# Adaptive Efficient Trainer (AET) for Large Models on Consumer GPUs

> A lightweight web service that profiles a user’s GPU, dataset, and model, then automatically configures mixed‑precision, gradient checkpointing, dynamic batch sizing, and gradient accumulation to maximize throughput while staying within memory limits.

| Estimated effort | 7 days |
| Status | Starter scaffold; implementation required |

## Start here

1. Read [PROJECT_BRIEF.md](PROJECT_BRIEF.md) completely.
2. Follow [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md).
3. Implement your Python application in `src/adaptive_efficient_trainer/`.
4. Add tests in `tests/`.
5. Measure the evaluation metrics from the project brief.
6. Record real results rather than invented performance claims.

## Local setup

Python 3.11 or newer is recommended.

Create a virtual environment, activate it for your operating system, then run:

    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
    pytest -q

## Repository contents

- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — detailed project specification.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` — implementation checklist.
- `src/adaptive_efficient_trainer/` — your application code.
- `tests/` — automated tests.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — basic Python CI.
- `data/` — add appropriate sample data.
- `artifacts/` — place generated outputs here when appropriate.

This repository contains a specification and a starter scaffold, not a finished
application. Implement and test the real functionality yourself.

Never commit API tokens, real `.env` files, private datasets, or personal records.
